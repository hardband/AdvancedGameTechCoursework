	// Update Position

	// a difference ).
	// - In this scenario , gravity / will / be increasing velocity over
	// time . The in - accuracy of not taking into account of these changes
	// over time can be visibly seen in tutorial 1.. and thus how better
	// integration schemes lead to better approximations by taking into
	// account of curvature .
	position += linVelocity * dt;


	// Update Orientation
	// - This is slightly different calculation due to the wierdness
	// of quaternions . It does the same thing as position update
	// ( with a slight error ) but from i’ve seen , is generally the best
	// way to update orientation .
	orientation = orientation + Quaternion(angVelocity * dt * 0.5f, 0.0f) * orientation;

	// ( Quaternion ( angVelocity * dt * 0.5f, 0.0 f)
	// * orientation ). ToMatrix3 ();
	// As the above formulation has slight approximation error , we need
	// to normalize our orientation here to stop them accumulating
	// over time .
